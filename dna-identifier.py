# Already identified sequences of irregular DNAâ€™s found in bacteria and viruses of common diseases are as follows:

# Malaria - GBC
# Typhoid - GCD
# HIV - GAA
# SARS - CAC

# TASK:

# Provided a full non-repeating DNA sequence of a patient.
# Identify presence of one or more common diseases in that patient by scanning his/her entire DNA sequence.
# Looking for patterns from the common diseases you have already researched above. 
# Output should include list of all the diseases and occurrence of those diseases identified in the complete DNA structure. 

# Example:
# Patient's DNA Sequence - BGDGBCFBCDDFGGCDCFCGBCBCDF
# Found:
# Malaria = 2
# Typhoid = 1
